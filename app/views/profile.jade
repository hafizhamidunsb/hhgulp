            | His lyrics for his songs that he writes are filled with profound messages, which he says are meant for himself. The lyrics are a reflection of the emotion he evokes and he wants his listeners to feel them. And they sure do. Even his non-Muslim listeners who come as far as mainland China, told him that they can relate to his songs, especially when they are about the love for God and the purpose of life. After all, Hafiz’s intentions are to promote peace.
